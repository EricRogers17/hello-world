# hello-world
My first repository

I'm from Portland, Oregon and it was freezing cold all day today. We had 
almost a foot of snow yesterday and the entire city decided to take the day off.
Instead of sledding down Mt. Tabor, I decided to stay in and continue my journey
to becoming a web developer some day.
